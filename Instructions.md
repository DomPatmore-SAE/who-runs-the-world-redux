1. You make an API call of which the response can be found in the file response.js. Write code that will return the number of leaders in the response.

2. Create a function that will take in a leader and return the title, first name, last name and country of the leader in one line.

3. Create an HTML document. The document should display the list of leaders found in the response. Each leader should have their own <div>, and should show the title, first and last name, and country.

4. Import moment.js. Create a function that will take in a string in 'yyyy-mm-dd' format, and return the number of days since that date.

5. Augment the function in (2) so that it includes the phrase "Number of days in office" and displays the number of days. Ensure this information is displayed for each leader.
