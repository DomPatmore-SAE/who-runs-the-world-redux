Please ensure your code is uploaded to GitHub and that is is functioning.
1. Create an HTML document. In the document, using fetch or otherwise, retrieve the contents of response.json, and write the number of leaders returned. There should be text that reads "There are X leaders available" where X is the number of leaders found. **Please do not simply write in the number** 
2. In the document, display each leader. Each should have their own <div>, and should show the title, first and last name, and country.
3. Create a function that will take in a leader and return the title, first name, last name and country of the leader in one line.
4. Import luxon.js. Create a function that will take in a string in 'yyyy-mm-dd' format, and return the number of days since that date.
5. Improve the function in (3) so that it includes the phrase "Number of days in office" and displays the number of days. Ensure this information is displayed for each leader.
